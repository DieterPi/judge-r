# R judge for Dodona

> Note: this judge makes extensive use of R environments to separate student code from test code. If you are not familiar with environments, it might be useful to read [this](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html).

## A basic exercise

The test file for a basic exercise can look like this:

```r
context({
  testcase('The correct method was used', {
    test_equal("test$alternative", function(env) { env$test$alternative }, 'two.sided')
    test_equal("test$method", function(env) { env$test$method }, ' Two Sample t-test')
  })
  testcase('p value is correct', {
    test_equal("test$p.value", function(env) { env$test$p.value }, 0.175)
  })
}, preExec = {
  set.seed(20190322)
})

context({
  testcase('x has the correct length', {
    test_equal("length(x)", function(env) { length(env$x) }, 100)
  })
})
```

Let's unpack what happens here.

### Tabs

First of all, something you can't see in the example code above. Dodona groups contexts in tabs. These are represented in the R judge by the files containing the test code. The name of the file (without the `.R`) extension is used to name the tab. A file should contain one or more calls to `context`.

### Contexts

A context represents one execution of the student code. It is generally desirable to have as many contexts as possible, since students can filter by incorrect contexts. The `context` function does a few things:

 1. It creates a clean environment based on the parent of the global environment. Students have access to the global environment, but only through the `globalenv()` function or the `.GlobalEnv` constant. This is not that big of a problem, since the same mechanism is used to execute the testing code (the global environment is therefore empty).
 2. It executes the code passed through the `preExec` argument in this clean environment. This can be used for setting the seed (as in this example), but also to set variables or define functions that students can then use.
 3. It executes the student's code in the clean environment. If the code errors out or generates warnings/messages these are caught and handled. An error will interrupt the execution and set the `runtime error` state for the the submission. It also adds a message to the context containing the error message generated by R. Warnings and messages do not interrupt execution, but are also added as messages to the context.
 4. It executes the first argument (a code block containing testcases) in the test environment.

Note that the student code is executed once for each call to `context`. Technically, this allows the student to store intermediate results in the global environment. The use of this is limited, so we don't see this as a problem.

### Testcases

Testcases group a number of related tests. The first argument of the `testcase` function is a description of that related group. The second argument is a code block (containing tests) which will be executed by the `testcase` function. There is little functionality in the `testcase` function. It is mostly used as a wrapper for the Dodona concept.

### Tests

A test is an actual evaluation of correctness. Multiple `test_*` functions are available and are explained in more detail below. The only constant thing for tests are the first three arguments:

 1. A description of the test. Preferably, this is something the student can copy-paste into their local R environment (e.g. `length(x)`, `test$p.value`, etc.).
 2. A function extracting the value to be tested from the student's environment. This function should take one argument (`env`) and return a value.
 3. The expected value. This is the value that the value extracted by the second parameter is compared to.

#### `test_equal`

The `test_equal` function uses the `base::all.equal` function internally to determine whether the two values are equal. Any parameters that can be passed to `all.equal` can be passed to `test_equal` (but the first three arguments need to be as described above).
